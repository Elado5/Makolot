A project done for a client - **Eli Stavi**, higher up in Rami Levi and chairman of Israel's small marketplace assosciation.

This is a fullstack project and the tech stack is:
- SQL
- NodeJS
- Express
- React

The project was to build an **online grocery shop** with a similar format to websites like 'Quick' or 'Shufersal' that works with a real database and also create a **fully working and functional admin interface**.


Project demo deployed on:
http://proj4.shenkar-tech.co.il/

The project will be uploaded to an official url once the client reaches certain agreements with distributors so we can upload the real products with the real prices.
